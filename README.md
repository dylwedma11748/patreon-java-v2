# patreon-java-v2
 A work in progress Java library for handling API calls to Patreon's APIv2 endpoints. Most of the classes have been written, but I'm still figuring out the other stuff.
 
 ## Library currently in active development
 In it's current state, all fields and relationships are confirmed to be working so long as you use the identity endpoint. I'm working on achieving this for all other endpoints as well. The library is still not ready for release yet.
