# patreon-java-v2
 A work in progress Java library for handling API calls to Patreon's APIv2 endpoints. Most of the classes have been written, but I'm still figuring out the other stuff.
 
 ## Library currently in active development
 In it's current state, some of the fields are confirmed to be working. But Relationships haven't been figured out quite yet. It is nowhere near ready for production use.
